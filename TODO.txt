GOAL: Understand the Concept of Separation of Concerns. Build a Working Music Player. Develop a strong understanding of JavaFX and it's tools.

META: Practice Unit Testing. A good time for this is while implementing (1a).
META: Poke around in Docker and make the player alone run in a docker.

1. Playlist Implementation.
1a. Add to the queue:
  * Open Playlist should only have .m3u and All Files options
  * ISSUE: Closing file selection without selecting a file throws an error
    - Potential Solutions:
      a. Emit an Event on the EventBus
        * Requires FileWindow to know about EventBus
        * Listener is in TopMenu to simply do nothing
      b. just deal with IndexOutOfBounds
        * FeelsBadMan, but it's not hindering the application.

1b. Reimplementation of AlbumArt
  - Emit new Event after loading a song to tell the window to display new art

1c. Save Playlist to file.
  * Use FileWriter to write a file in .m3u
  * Take the current queue, and write it into a .m3u format
    - #EXTM3U
    - \n
    - #EXTINF %d, %s - %s
    - filePaths
    - \n
    - For each path
  * POSSIBLE ISSUE: Spaces
    - Convert to %20

2. Display Playlist in GUI.

3. Enhance UI more:
3a. Make SeekBar transitions smooth
3b. SeekBar is colored to the left of the slider.
3c. Use Images for Labels instead of text.
3d. UI Components only work when music is selected.
3e. Add Label to show stop time. (Basic Look: CURRENT ----SEEKBAR---- STOP)

?. Prepare for first release?
?a. research how to package code and deploy
