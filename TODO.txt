GOAL: Understand the Concept of Separation of Concerns. Build a Working Music Player. Develop a strong understanding of JavaFX and it's tools.

META: Practice Unit Testing.
META: Poke around in Docker and make the player alone run in a docker.

1. Playlist Implementation.
1a. Add to the queue:
  * Open Playlist should only have .m3u and All Files options

1c. Save Playlist to file.
  * Use FileWriter to write a file in .m3u
  * Take the current queue, and write it into a .m3u format
    - #EXTM3U
    - \n
    - #EXTINF %d, %s - %s
    - filePaths
    - \n
    - For each path
  * POSSIBLE ISSUE: Spaces
    - Convert to %20

2. Display Playlist in GUI.
